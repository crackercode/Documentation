Securing Network Connectivity

Confidentiality - Priniciple of least privilege [Restricts access to information]
Intergrity - Prevention of unauthorized changes to information [Use one way hash - encryption]
Availability - Ensure services remain available to authorized users [Stop DDOS]

Azure firewall - MS managed network security service in the Azure that protects Azure vNet resources
 - Ex : Use static public ip address to represent vNet resources. Inbound Outbound filtering rules
 
Azure DDos Protection
	Basic - by default enabled
	Standard - add mitigation capabilities
	
NSG - Network Security Groups (NSGs) - Filter network traffic to and from Azure resources connected to vNet
	- Inbound and Outbound rules
	
Application Security Groups - Configure network security as an extension of an applications structure

Azure Active Directory - MS Azure based identity and access management service.
	- allows users to sign in and access resources
	- AD free and AD Premium P1
	
Azure AD Features 
	- Application management features - Application proxy, Single sign on, My apps portal
	- Authentication features - self service password reset, Multi-Factor authentication, Banned pw lists, Smart lockout
	- Hybrid identity features - AD connect and connect health
	- Reporting and monitoring features - Insights into security and usage patterns
	- Privileged identity management (PIM) - Manage, control and monitor access to resources

Authentication - Main function of Azure AD is the verification or authentication of credentials any time an end user singns into a device, service or application 
	Ex : Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, Self service pw reset (SSPR), Passwordless authentication (Windows 10 hello)

Single Sign On (SSO) - Automatically signs users in when they are on their corporate devices connected to your corporate network
Application Management - Application management in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the process of creating, configuring, managing, and monitoring applications in the cloud 
Business to Business (B2B) - can securely share your company's applications and services with external users, while maintaining control over your own corporate data
	- Share apps and services with guest users
Business to Customer (B2C) - customers use their preferred social(FB), enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications and APIs
Device Management - Management of cloud and on prem devices

Azure AD Domain Services (AADDS) - managed version of on prem AD
	- Domain join, Group policy, LDAP, Kerberos, NTLM authentication
	- Managed domain is configured for one way synchronization from Azure AD

Conditional Access(Paid) - Allows you to specify conditions(user, location, device, application, risk) under which users can access apps and data.
	- user or group membership - allows you to target specific users and groups with the policy
	- named location information - created using ip address ranges. Used when making policy decision
	- Device - allows you to create a policy that targets users with specific devices or with devices in a specific state
	- application - signal ensures that users who are trying to access specific applications will trigger different conditional access policies
	- real time sign in risk detection - allows a conditional access policy to identify resky sign in behaviour
	- cloud apps or actions - is used to include or exclude certain cloud application or user actions
	- user risk - is onlu available to customer that have access to identify protection. It refers to the probability that an account is compromised

Azure AD role based access control - Used to control permissions for Azure AD resource management
	- Global administrator - provide access to all administrative features in AD. Sign up for AD tenant = GA
	- User administrator - create and manages all aspects of users and groups. manages subscriptions and support tickets, monitor health
	- Billing administrator - make purchases, manages subscriptions and support tickets, monitor service health
	
	- Custom rols - flexible access. organization wide scope, object scope. only for AD premium P1 or AD premium P2.
	- Role based access control - manage access using roles
	
Zero trust methodology - t

Guiding principles
	- Verify explicitly - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
	- Use least privilege access - Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
	- Assume breach - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses

Six Foundation Pillars
	- Identities - verify before identities access a resource
	- Devices - monitor device for health and compliance
	- Applications - discover all apps in use, whether we know about them or not
	- Data - Data should be classified, labeled and encrypted based on it's attributes
	- Infastructure - use telemetry to detect attacks and other anomalies
	- Network - sementing networks improves your security 
	
Defence in Depth - prevents data breaches and slows down unauthenticated attempts to access data. 7 layers of protection and validation
	- Physical - typically limits access to the datacenter to only authorized personnel
	- Identity & access - controll access to infastructure and change control
	- Perimeter - filter and protects againts DDos.
	- Network - limit communication between resources
	- Compute layer - can secure access to VM by closing ports
	- Application layer - ensure applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilites
	- Data layer - controll acess to business and customer data. encryption
	
CIA
	Confidentiality - keep sensitive data confidential
	Intergrity - keep data or messages correct
	Availability - make data available those who need it
	
Defender for cloud -  is a tool for security posture management and threat protection
	- Strengthens security posture of cloud resources through and integrated collection of plans
	- Defender for cloud protects workloads running in Azure,hybrid and other cloud platforms
	- Secure score - central feature in defender for cloud
	
Monitoring and Reporting  - used to logically organize your Azure resources. Add meta data

Azure monitor - collect analyze cloud and on pre env

Role based access control - provide fine grained access management for Azure resources

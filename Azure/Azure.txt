Cloud Computing - The delivery of computing services, like serviers, storage, databases, networking over internet.
Cloud computing is the delivery if compute services over internet to provide faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies if scale
Pay only for cloud services you use

Cost - Eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on site datacenters

Speed - Computing resources can be provisioned in minutes

Performance - Azure runs on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which regularly upgraded

Reliability - Data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity are easir and less expnesive

Cloud models 
	- Public cloud - Offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them
				   - Cloud resources are owned and operated by the cloud service provider
				   - 
	- Private Cloud - Used only by users from one business or organization
					- Can be physically located in on-site datacenter or can be hosted by 2rd party service provider
	- Hybrid cloud - Combines a public and private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them
	
Scalability - apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally
	- Vertical - Increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPU
	- Horizontally - Increase compute capacity by adding instances or resources. Add vm's to confugration

Elasticity - use autoscaling 

Agility - Deploy and configure cloud based resources quickly as app requirments change

Geo-distribution - Deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the world to ensure 
	that your customers always have the best performance in their region.
	
Disaster Recovery - Cloud based backup services, data replication options and geo-distribution allow data safety during disaster

Capital Expenditure - up front spending of money on physical infastructure
	- Requires significant up-front financial costs, ongoing maintenance, and support expenditures

Operational Expenditure - is spending money on services or products now, and beign billed for them now. Ex cloud services
	- Consumption-based model, organization is only responsible for the cost of the computing resources used.

Infastructure as a service (IaaS) - offers compute,storage and networking resources on demand (pay as you go)
	- service provider manages the infastructure. Customer purchases, installs, configures and manages software. 
	- Ex OS, VM, Storage accounts

Platform as a service (PaaS) - Development / deployment environment in the cloud
	- Avoid expense and complexity of byuing and managing software licenses, underlaying application infastructure, BI services and middleware
	- SQL databases, Azure app services
	
Software as a service (SaaS) - allows users to connect and use cloud based apps over the internet. 
	- Ex : Outlook email, Ms office 365
	- Use cases - Customer relationship management (CRM), Enterprice resource planning (ERP), Doc management
	
Azure regions - is a geographical area that contains at least one datacenters that are networked together with a low latency network
	- some services or features are only available in certain regions
	- Minimum 3 AZ within single region (Region >= 3 AZ)
	
Availability zones - created by using one or more datacenters iquipped with independent power, cooling and networking
	- AZ's are connected through high-speed, private fibre optic networks 

Region pairs - Each region is paired with another region within the same geography at least 300 miles away
	- if region affected by natural disaster services would automatically failover to other region in its region pair
	- one region is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible
	
Resource - is manageable item that's available through azure. Ex VM, Application gateway, Azure cosmos DB

Resource group - is a container that holds related resources for an azure solution
	- All resources must be in a resource group
	- A resource can only be a memeber of a single resource group
	- Grouping resources by lifecycle simplifies management of such resources. Delete RG will delete sql vm both.
		so group db in same RG.
	- help to apply Role-based access control (RBAC. Ex VM, SQL admin) premissions

Azure subscription - Provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services
	- is a logical unit of azure services that links to an Azure account which is an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in  a directory that azure AD trusts.
	- Allows you to provision resources
	- An account can have one or multiple subscriptions
	- Used to define boundaries around azure products, services and resources
	- Manage and track costs based on your needs( Ex track dev qa cost)

Billing boundaries - Datemines how an azure account is billed for using Azure

Access control boundary - Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level
	- can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organization structures
	- can create separate subscriptions to set up separate env for DEV, QA or to isolate data for compliance reasons

Invoice sections - Multiple subscription

Billing profiles - Multiple invoice sections. Generate invoices and payment methods

Billing account - Multiple billing profiles

Management Groups - allows you to manage Access, policies compliance for multiple subscriptions.
	- All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Azure Ad tenant.
	- Provides a level of scope above subscriptions. Ex HR(DEV+QA), Marketting(Free Trial+ EA subscription)	 
	- Organize subscription into containers called MG and apply your governance conditions to the MG.
	- Subscription within a management group automatically inheri the conditions applied to the MG.
	- Used to break out user access to multiple subscriptions.

Availability sets - a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability

Azure compute - is an on-demand computing service for running cloud based applications. Ex : VM, Container Instances, App Service, Functions

Virtual machines - include a virtusa processor, memory, storage and networking resources
	
VM Scale Set - Used confiture and deploy identical VM's. Autoscaling. As demand increases VM can be added and as demand decreases VM can be removed
	- Process can be manual or automated or combination of both

Containers and Kubernates - Azure compute resources that you can used to deploy and manage containers
	- Lightweight, Virtusalized application env(Can be deployed anywhere)
	- can run multiple instances of a containerized application on a single host machine

App Service (PaaS) - Quickly build,deploy and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile and API apps running on any platform

Functions - concerned only about the code running your service and not the underlaying platform or infastructure
	- Used when you need to perform work in response to an event. timer or message from another azure service
	
Azure Container Instances (ACI) - Package, deploy and manage cloud apps
	- Fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage VMs
	- Great for scenarios that can operate in isolated containers
	
Azure Container Registry - 

Azure Kubernates Service - AKS - Deploy a managed kubernetes cluster in Azure
	- Kubernates masters are managed bu Azure. User manages and maintains agent nodes
	- User if you need full container orchestration
	
Azure portal - Deploy, manage and delete azure resources

Azure PowerShell - connect to azure subscription and deploy, manage and delete azure resources

Azure CLI - A cross platform command line program to connect to Azure and execute administrative commands

Azure Cloud Shell - Browser based scripting environment

Azure Mobile App - Access manage monitor Azure accounts and resources from IOS and Android.
	- Get notifications and alerts about important health issues and diagnose and fix many issues
	- Start stop and restart VM's and web apps
	- Connect to your VM and manage permission with role based access control

Azure REST APIs - Service endpoints that support sets if HTTP operations
	 - Provide create, retrieve, update and delete access to the service resources
	 - When developing solutions that need to talk to Azure
	 
Azure Advisor - Free service that helps you follow best practices to optimize deployments
	- Recommendations on availability, security, performance and cost.

Address Space - Specify a custom private IP address space using public and private addresses
	 - Azure assign resources in a virtual network a private IP address from the address space
	 
Virtual network = Subnet = VM1 + VM2
	- scoped to a single region/location
	- Scoped to a single subscription
	- can have multiple vNet within each subscription and region
	- Key networking capabilities
		- Isolation
		- Segmentation
		- Internet communications
		- Communication between azure resources
		- Communication between on prem resources
		- Route network traffic
		- Filter network traffic
		- Connect virtual networks

Subnets - Segment virtual network into sub networks. Deploy azure resources in  a specific subnet
	- Segment virtual network address space as appropriate
	- Secure resources within subnets with Network Security Groups

Virtusa Network Peering - Connect multiple VNet from different regions
	- Traffic between peered vNet is private
	- No public internet, gateway. Encryption required 
	Virtual network peering - connect vNet within same region
	Global virtual network peering - connect vNet across regions

Communicate between Azure resources
		- Virtual networks - connect VM's and other azure resources (App service env for power apps, AKS, VM scale set)
		- Service endpoints - connect to other azure resource types (Azure SQL, storage accounts)
		
Communicate with on-prem resources 
	- Point to site VPN's - VPN connection is from a computer outside the organization, back into the corparate network
		- Client computer initiates an encypted VPN connection to connect that computer to the Azure vNet.
	- Site to site VPN's -  Link on prem VPN device or gateway to azure VPN gateway in vNet
		- Connection is encrypted and works over the internet		
	- Azure ExpressRoute - environments where you need greater bandwith and even higher level of security
		- Dedicated private connectivity to azure that doesn't travel over the internet
	
Route Network Traffic - routes traffic between subnets on any connected VM, on prem networks and into. Use route tablesm Boarder gateway protocol, BGP

Route tables - Defines rules about how traffic should be directed

Border Gateway Protocol - BGP - Propogate on prem BGP routes to azure vNet.
	- Works with azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server, ExpressRoute
	
vNet filter network traffic between subnets by using Network Security Groups and Network Virtual Appliances

Network Security Groups - contains inbound and outbound security rules	
	
Network Virtual Appliances - Specialized VM that can be compared to a hardened network appliance
	- Execute network functions - firewall or WAN optimization
	
User Defined Routes - Allow network admin to control the routing tables between subnets within a vNet as well as between vNets

Azure DNS - Provide name resolution by using azure infastructure
	- Can't use azure DNS to buy a domain name
	- Doesn't support DNSSEC
	
Azure DNS Private Resolver - Query DNS private zones from an on prem env and vice verse without deploying VM-based DNS servers.

VPN Gateway - VPN's use an encrypted tunnel within another network
	- Deployed to connect 2 or more trusted private networks to one another over an untrusted network (Public Internet)
	- Traffic is encrypted while traveling over the untrusted network
		- Policy based - Specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel
		- Route based VPN - are preferred connection method for on prem devices
	- Allows u to connect on prem datacenters to vNets through a site-to-site connection
	- Allows connect individual devices to vNet through a point-to-ste connection
	- Allows connect vNet to other virtusal networks through a network-to-network connection
	
Azure ExpressRoute - Extends on prem networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection via a connectivity provider.
	- Don't go over the public internet. So reliable, faster, consistent latencies, higher security
	- Connect on prem to office365, Dunamics 265, Azure private peering for vNet
	- Connectivity options - any-to-any, point-to-point, virtusal cross connection

Cloud Computing - The delivery of computing services, like serviers, storage, databases, networking over internet.
Cloud computing is the delivery if compute services over internet to provide faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies if scale
Pay only for cloud services you use

Cost - Eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on site datacenters

Speed - Computing resources can be provisioned in minutes

Performance - Azure runs on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which regularly upgraded

Reliability - Data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity are easir and less expnesive

Cloud models 
	- Public cloud - Offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them
				   - Cloud resources are owned and operated by the cloud service provider
				   - 
	- Private Cloud - Used only by users from one business or organization
					- Can be physically located in on-site datacenter or can be hosted by 2rd party service provider
	- Hybrid cloud - Combines a public and private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them
	
Scalability - apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally
	- Vertical - Increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPU
	- Horizontally - Increase compute capacity by adding instances or resources. Add vm's to confugration

Elasticity - use autoscaling 

Agility - Deploy and configure cloud based resources quickly as app requirments change

Geo-distribution - Deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the world to ensure 
	that your customers always have the best performance in their region.
	
Disaster Recovery - Cloud based backup services, data replication options and geo-distribution allow data safety during disaster

Capital Expenditure - up front spending of money on physical infastructure
	- Requires significant up-front financial costs, ongoing maintenance, and support expenditures

Operational Expenditure - is spending money on services or products now, and beign billed for them now. Ex cloud services
	- Consumption-based model, organization is only responsible for the cost of the computing resources used.

Infastructure as a service (IaaS) - offers compute,storage and networking resources on demand (pay as you go)
	- service provider manages the infastructure. Customer purchases, installs, configures and manages software. 
	- Ex OS, VM, Storage accounts

Platform as a service (PaaS) - Development / deployment environment in the cloud
	- Avoid expense and complexity of byuing and managing software licenses, underlaying application infastructure, BI services and middleware
	- SQL databases, Azure app services
	
Software as a service (SaaS) - allows users to connect and use cloud based apps over the internet. 
	- Ex : Outlook email, Ms office 365
	- Use cases - Customer relationship management (CRM), Enterprice resource planning (ERP), Doc management
	
Azure regions - is a geographical area that contains at least one datacenters that are networked together with a low latency network
	- some services or features are only available in certain regions
	- Minimum 3 AZ within single region (Region >= 3 AZ)
	
Availability zones - created by using one or more datacenters iquipped with independent power, cooling and networking
	- AZ's are connected through high-speed, private fibre optic networks 

Region pairs - Each region is paired with another region within the same geography at least 300 miles away
	- if region affected by natural disaster services would automatically failover to other region in its region pair
	- one region is prioritized to make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible
	
Resource - is manageable item that's available through azure. Ex VM, Application gateway, Azure cosmos DB

Resource group - is a container that holds related resouces for an azure solution
	- All resouces must be in a resource group
	- A resouce can only be a memeber of a single resouce group
	- Grouping resouces by lifecycle simplifies management of such resouces. Delete RG will delete sql vm both.
		so group db in same RG.
	- help to apply Role-based access control (RBAC. Ex VM, SQL admin) premissions

Azure subscription - Provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services
	- is a logical unit of azure services that links to an Azure account which is an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in  a directory that azure AD trusts.
	- Allows you to provision resources
	- An account can have one or multiple subscriptions
	- Used to define boundaries around azure products, services and resources
	- Manage and track costs based on your needs( Ex track dev qa cost)

Billing boundaries - Datemines how an azure account is billed for using Azure

Access control boundary - Azure applies access-management policies at the subscription level
	- can create separate subscriptions to reflect different organization structures
	- can create separate subscriptions to set up separate env for DEV, QA or to isolate data for compliance reasons

Invoice sections - Multiple subscription

Billing profiles - Multiple invoice sections. Generate invoices and payment methods

Billing account - Multiple billing profiles

Management Groups - allows you to manage Access, policies compliance for multiple subscriptions.
	- All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Azure Ad tenant.
	- Provides a level of scope above subscriptions. Ex HR(DEV+QA), Marketting(Free Trial+ EA subscription)	 
	- Organize subscription into containers called MG and apply your governance conditions to the MG.
	- Subscription within a management group automatically inheri the conditions applied to the MG.
	- Used to break out user access to multiple subscriptions.

Availability sets - a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability

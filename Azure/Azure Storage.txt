Azure Storage Accounts - Provide a unique namespace for your azure storage data that's accessible from anywhere over HTTP(S).
	- Standard general purpose v2
	- Premium block blobs
	- Premium files shares
	- Premium page blobs

Azure Blob Storage - obect storage solution. optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data.
	- can access via HTTP(s), Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Azure Storage client library

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Blob Container - A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. 
A storage account can include an unlimited number of containers, and a container can store an unlimited number of blobs.

Blobs - Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud

Storage Access Tiers 
	- Hot access tier - storing data that is accessed or modified frequently
	- Cool tier - for storing data that is infrequently accessed or modified stored for a minimum of 30 days
	- Archive tier - storing data that is rarely accessed, and that has flexible latency requirements, for a minimum of 180 days
	
Azure Files - Fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry 
	standard Server Message Block(SMB)(Windows,MAC,Linux) protocol or Network File System(NFS)(Linux,MAC) protocol.
	
Azure Queues - Store large number of messages
	- each queue maintains a list of messages that can be added by a sender component and processed by a receiver component
	
Azure Table Storage - Stores non relational structured data in the cloud
	- Provide key/attribute store with a schemaless design
	- Acces is typical lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data
	- Stores flexible datasets like user data for web apps, address books, device info
	- Stores datasets that doesn't require complex joins, fk or stored procedures
	
Azure managed disks - Block level storage volumes managed by Azure

Types of managed disks :
	- Ultra disks - Highest performing storage option for azure VM's. Data intensive workloads
	- Premium solid state drives - High performance and low latency disk for VM's. IO intensive workloads
		- Mission critical production appls
	- Standard SSDs - for workloads that need consistent performance at lower IOPS levels.
		- web servers, low IOPS app servers, non prod workloads
	- Standard Hard Disk Drives - Deliver reliable low cost disk support. latency tolerant workloads
Types of disk roles : 
	- Data Disk -  to store application data, or other data you need to keep
	- OS Disk - Every VM has one operating system disk. Pre installed OS when VM created
	- Temporary Disk - Short term storage for applications and processes
	
Locally Redundant Storage(LRS) - copies data synchronously three times within a single physical location(data center) in the primary region
	- lower cost and least durable.
	- Protects data againts server rack and drive failures
	- Ex : apps is restricted to replicating data only within a country or region due to data governance

Zone Redundant Storage(ZRS) - copies data synchronously across three AZ in primary region
	- High availability
	- Ex : restricted replication of data to within a country or region to meet data governance
	- ZRS support Blob, Azure files, Azure table storage, Azure queue storage
	
Geo	Redundant Storage (GRS) - copies data synchronously 3x within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS

Geo Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS) - copies data synchronously across 3x AZ in the primary region using ZRS
	- Support Blob, Azure files, Azure table storage, Azure queue storage

with GRS and GZRS data in secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there is a failover.

RA-GRS or RA-GZRS - configure allow read access to secondary region.

AzCopy - Copy blob or files from storage account
	Blob - Azure AD & SAS(Shared Access Signature Token)
	File - SAS
	
Azure File Sync - Centralize file shares in Azure files
Access Protocols
	- SMB (Server Message Block)
	- NFS (Network File System)
	- FTPS (File transfter protocol secure)
	
Cloud Tiering - Frequently accessed files are cached on local server
	- Least frequently accessed files are tiered to the cloud
	- Tiered files can quickly be recalled on demand
	- Ex : ideal for distributed access scenario. Changes made to server in one automatically sync to others
	
Cloud site backups - Take centralized backups in the cloud using Azure Backup

Azure Consmos DB - globally distributed database service that enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage

Azure SQL Database - is a relational DB as a service(Daas) based on the latest version of MS SQL server DB engine.

Azure Migrate - Centralize hub to access and migrate on prem servers, infastructure, apps and date to Azure.
	Azure Migrate : Discovery and Assessment - allows you to discover and access servers including SQL and web apps
	Azure Migrate : Server Migration - is used to migrate VMware VMs, Hyper VMs, Physical servers, virtualized servers public cloud VMs to Azure
	Data Migration Assistant - migrate SQL server DB to Azure SQL database, Azure SQL managed instance, Azure VMs running SQL server
	Azure Database Migraration Service - Migrate on prem database to Azure VMs running SQL server, Azure SQL DB, SQL managed instance
	Movere (SaaS) - Movere automates discovery, scanning, and collection of IT data within your organization. 
		You analyze collected data to learn about your infrastructure, devices, and apps, make smart decisions, and facilitate migration to the cloud
	Web/Azure app Migration Assistant - Migrate on prem web apps and to migrate them to Azure
	Azure Data Box - Migrate large amounts of offline data to Azure

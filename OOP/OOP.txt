Inheritance - Object of one class gets properties and behaviour of another class.
why - code reusability, method overriding, 
super - Used to access parent methods and variables

Polymorphism - Ability to take more than one form

	-> Compile time polymorphism(Method oveloading) - Method with same name but different method signature(Method name + No of arguments, Argument type)
													  Same method name and signature but different return type will throw compile error
	
	It improves code clarity and allows for the use of a single name for similar procedures.
	It has a faster execution time since it is discovered early in the compilation process
	
	-> Runtime polymorphism(Method overriding)

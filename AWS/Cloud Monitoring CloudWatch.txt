CloudWatch - provides metrics for every services in AWS

CloudWatch Alarms - used to trigger notifications for any metric
- Auto Scaling: increase or decrease EC2 instances “desired” count
- EC2 Actions: stop, terminate, reboot or recover an EC2 instance
- SNS notifications: send a notification into an SNS topic

CloudWatch Logs - Enables real-time monitoring of logs
- can collect log from Elastic Beanstalk ,ECS, AWS Lambda, CloudTrail, Route53
- By default, no logs. You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files

Amazon EventBridge - CloudWatch Events
	- Schedule: Cron jobs; Ex invoke lambda
	- Event Pattern: Event rules to react to a service doing something : IAM Root User Sign in Event
	
Types
	- Default Event Bus - from AWS Services
	- Partner Event Bus - from AWS SaaS Partners Eg: Zendesk
	- Custom Event Bus - from Custom app
	
CloudTrail - Provides governance, compliance and audit for your AWS Account
	- Get an history of events / API calls made within your AWS Account
	- A trail can be applied to All Regions (default) or a single Region
	- If a resource is deleted in AWS, investigate CloudTrail first
	
AWS X-Ray - Debugging in Production

AWS X -Ray advantages
- Troubleshooting performance (bottlenecks) 
- Understand dependencies in a microservice architecture 
- Pinpoint service issues - Review request behavior 
- Find errors and exceptions - Are we meeting time SLA? 
- Where I am throttled? 
- Identify users that are impacted

CodeGuru - automated code reviews and application performance recommendations 
	- CodeGuru Reviewer: automated code reviews for static code analysis (development)
	- CodeGuru Profiler: visibility/recommendations about application performance during runtime (production)

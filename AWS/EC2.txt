EC2 User Data - Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts, only run once at instace first start. 
Script runs with root user.

m : instance class
5 : generation
2xlarge : size within the instance class

Security Group - A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. 
Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. 
Security groups are associated with network interfaces. Can be attached to multiple instaces. Locked down to a region/VPC combination. 
Good to maintain one separate SG for SSH access. All inbound traffic is blocked and outbound traffic is authorized by default. 
Used to commiunicate through EC2 no need to worry about IP's.

22 - SSH (Secure Shell) - Log into to a linux instace
21 - FTP (File transfer Portocol) - Upload files into a file share
22 - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Portocol) - Upload files using SSH
80  - HTTP - Access unsecured websites
443 - HTTPS - Access secured websites
3389 - RDP - (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a windows instace

SSH to EC2 instance - Add SG with port 22 open to EC2.
ssh -i C:\..\key.pem ec2-user@public-ip
Change permission of pem.
Linux - chmod 004 C:\..\key.pem
Windows - Righ click -> Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> change owner ->  Add full controll permission.
Never enter your IAM APA key(Access Key and Secret Access Key). Instead use IAM rules.

IM Roles - Provide aws credentials to aws services like EC2. Then can access other service without entering secrets.

Instance Launch Types 
- On demand instances - short workload
- Reserved (Min 1yr) 
	- Reserved Instances - long workloads (ex : DB)
	- Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances - can change EC2 instance type 
	- Scheduled Reserved Instances - every monday between 1 and 2pm
- Spot instances - short workloads,cheap, can lose instances(less reliable)
- Dedicated hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement. Most expensive.

Compute Optimized -
Storage Optimized - workloads requiring high,sequantial read/write access to large data sets on local storage

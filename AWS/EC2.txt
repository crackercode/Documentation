EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = IaaS

It mainly consists in the capability of :
	- Renting virtual machines (EC2)
	- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
	- Distributing load across machines (ELB)
	- Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

EC2 sizing & configuration options - OS, CPU, RAM, Network-attached (EBS & EFS), hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address, Firewall rules: security group, Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data 

EC2 User Data - Bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts, only run once at instace first start. 
Script runs with root user. Ex : Installing updates, Installing software

x5.2xlarge
m : instance class
5 : generation
2xlarge : size within the instance class

EC2 Instance Types 
	- General Purpose(t2)
	- Compute Optimized - compute-intensive tasks that require high performance - Machine Learning, Gaming
	– Memory Optimized - workloads that process large data sets in memory - relational/non-relational databases
	- Storage Optimized - storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
						  access to large data sets on local storage - Data warehousing
	
Security Group - A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. 
	- Access to Ports, Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6, Control of inbound network, Control of outbound network 	
	- Inbound rules control the incoming traffic to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. 
	- Security groups are associated with network interfaces. Can be attached to multiple instaces. Locked down to a region/VPC combination. 
	- Good to maintain one separate SG for SSH access - best practice.
	- All inbound traffic is blocked and outbound traffic is authorized by default. 
	- Used to commiunicate through EC2 no need to worry about IP's.

22 - SSH (Secure Shell) - Log into to a linux instace
21 - FTP (File transfer Portocol) - Upload files into a file share
22 - SFTP (Secure File Transfer Portocol) - Upload files using SSH
80  - HTTP - Access unsecured websites
443 - HTTPS - Access secured websites
3389 - RDP - (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a windows instace

Never enter your IAM API key(Access Key and Secret Access Key) using aws configure inside EC2. Instead use IAM rules.

IM Roles - Provide aws credentials to aws services like EC2. Then can access other service without entering secrets.

Instance Launch Types 
- On demand instances - short workload, Has the highest cost, short-term and un-interrupted workloads, 
  where you can't predict how the application will behave
- Reserved (Min 1yr)
	* Reservation Period – 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
	* Payment Options – No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)
	* Reserved Instance’s Scope – Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
	- Reserved Instances - long workloads (ex : DB)
	- Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances - can change EC2 instance type 
	- Scheduled Reserved Instances - every monday between 1 and 2pm
- Spot instances - short workloads, cheapest, can lose instances(less reliable)
- Dedicated hosts - Book an entire physical server, control instance placement. Most expensive.
- Dedicated Instances – Instances run on hardware that’s dedicated to you, no other customers will share your hardware
                        No control over instance placement (Diff with instace host)
- Capacity Reservations – Reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

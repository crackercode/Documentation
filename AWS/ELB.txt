Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

Scalability - means that an application / system can handle greater loads
by adapting
	- Vertical Scalability - Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
							 change t2.micro to t2.large
	- Horizontal Scalability - Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of 
							   instances / systems for your application
							   Eg : EC2 and Auto Scaling Groups and Load Balancer
						
High Availability - Run instances for the same application across multi AZ
	- Auto Scaling Group multi AZ and Load Balancer multi AZ
	
ELB - Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream. 

Types of load balancers offered by AWS:
 - Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS only) – Layer 7
 - Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) – Layer 4
 - Gateway Load Balancer - Deploy, scale, and manage your third-party virtual appliances. 
 - Classic Load Balancer (slowly retiring) – Layer 4 & 7

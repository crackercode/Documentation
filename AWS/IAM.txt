IAM (Identity and Access Management), Global Service. Groups only contains users not other groups. 
Root account - created by default, should not be used or shared 
User don't have to belong to group but user can belong to multiple groups. 

IAM : Permission = Policies. Apply least privilege principle.
IAM Policies inheritance - Create a group and add policy to group and assign users.

IAM : Password Policy
	- Strong password
	- Multi Factor Authentication - MFA
		- Virtusal MFA device - Google Authenticator
		- Universal 2nd Factor [(U2F) Security Key]
		- Hardware MFA Device
		
How can user access AWS
	- AWS management console - Password + MFA
	- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) - Access Key
	- AWS Software Developer Kit (SDK) - Access Key
	
Access Key - Just like password

IM Roles - Used assign Permission to AWS services. AWS services perform actions on your behalf. 
		   Ex : EC2 Instance Roles, Lambda Function Roles, Roles for CloudFormation
		   
IAM Credentials Reports - List all your account users and status
IAM Access Advisor - Shows service permissions granted to a user and last access info.
				   - Can used to remove unwanted policies
				
AIM Guidelines & Best Practices

Don't use root account except for AWS account setup
One physical user = One AWS User
Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
Create a strong password policy
Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report
Never share IAM users & Access Keys				

Shared Responsibilities Model for IM
AWS - Infastructure
	- Configuration and vulnerability validation
	- Compliance Validation
You - Users, Groups, Roles, Policies management and monitoring
	- Enable MDA on all accounts
	- Rotate all your keys often
	- Use IAM tools to apply appropriate permissions
	- Anylyze access patterns & Review Permission

Types
Synchronous communications (application to application)
Asynchronous / Event based (application to queue to application)

Decouple your applications:
- using SQS: queue model
- using SNS: pub/sub model
- using Kinesis: real-time data streaming model

SQS - Simple Queue Service - use to decouple applications

Kinesis - real-time big data streaming
- Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale

Kinesis Data Streams: low latency streaming to ingest data at scale from hundreds of thousands of sources
Kinesis Data Firehose: load streams into S3, Redshift, ElasticSearch, etc
Kinesis Data Analytics: perform real-time analytics on streams using SQL
Kinesis Video Streams: monitor real-time video streams for analytics or ML

SNS - Simple Notification Service
- send one message to many receivers
- event publishers” only sends message sns topic Each subscriber to the topic will get all the messages

Amazon MQ - managed Apache ActiveMQ
has both queue feature (SQS) and topic features (SNS)

SQS:
- Queue service in AWS
- Multiple Producers, messages are kept up to 14 days
- Multiple Consumers share the read and delete messages when done
- Used to decouple applications in AWS
SNS:
- Notification service in AWS
- Subscribers: Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile…
- Multiple Subscribers, send all messages to all of them
- No message retention
Kinesis: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis
Amazon MQ: managed Apache MQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP.. protocols)

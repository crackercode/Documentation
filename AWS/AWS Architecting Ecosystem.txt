AWS Cloud Best Practices – Design Principles

- Scalability: vertical & horizontal
- Disposable Resources: servers should be disposable & easily configured
- Automation: Serverless, Infrastructure as a Service, Auto Scaling…
- Loose Coupling:
	- Monolith are applications that do more and more over time, become bigger
	- Break it down into smaller, loosely coupled components
	- A change or a failure in one component should not cascade to other components
- Services, not Servers:
	- Don’t use just EC2
	- Use managed services, databases, serverless, etc !

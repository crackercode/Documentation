DDOS Protection on AWS
AWS Shield Standard - Free service that is activated for every AWS customer

AWS WAF - Filter specific requests based on rules
Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List) :
	- Rules can include IP addresses, HTTP headers, HTTP body, or URI strings
	- Protects from common attack - SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
	- Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
	- Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of events)

Encryption Types
Data at rest - data stored or archived on a device
In transit (in motion) - data being moved from one location to another
					   - Ex Transfer from on-premises to AWS, EC2 to DynamoDB

AWS KMS (Key Management Service) - AWS manages the encryption keys for us
	- Ex : Encryption Automatically enabled: CloudTrail Logs, S3 Glacier, Storage Gateway
	
CloudHSM - AWS provisions encryption hardware

CMK - Customer Master Keys - Customer Managed CMK , AWS managed CMK, AWS owned CMK, CloudHSM Keys

ACM - AWS Certificate Manager - easily provision, manage, and deploy SSL/TLS Certificates

AWS Secrets Manager - storing secrets Secrets are encrypted using KMS

AWS Artifact - Portal that provides customers with on-demand access to AWS compliance documentation and AWS agreements

Amazon GuardDuty - Intelligent Threat discovery to Protect AWS Account. Uses Machine Learning algorithms, anomaly detection

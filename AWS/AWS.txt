** Five characteristics of cloud computing
on-demand self service - User can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
Board network access - Resources availablity over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
Multi-tenancy and resouce pooling - Multiple customers can share the same infastructure and applications with security and privacy
								  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
Rapid elasticity and scalability - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resouces when needed
								 - Quickly and easily scale based on demand
Measured service - Usage is measured, user pay correctly for what they have used

** Six advantages of clould computing
Trade capital expense(CAPEX) for operational expense(OPEX)
	- Pay on-deamand: don;t own hardware
	- Refuced total cost of ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
Benifit from massive economies of scale - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
Stop guessing capacity - Scale based on actual measured usage
Increase speed and agility
Stop spending money running and maitaining data centers
Go global in minutes - leverage the AWS global infastructure

** Problem solved by the cloud
Flexibility - change resouce types when needed
Cost-Effectiveness - pay as you go, form what you use
Scalability - accomadate larger loads by making hardwar stronger or adding additional nodes
Elasticity - ability to scale out and scale in when neede
High-availability and fault-tolerances - build across data centers
Agility - Rapid develop,test and launch software applications

Types of cloud computing
On-premises
Infastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
	- EC2
	- Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
	- Elastic beanstalk
	- Heroku, Google App Engine
Software as a Service (SaaS)
	- Rekognition
	- MS office, Gmail
Function as a Service (FaaS)
	- Lambda
	
** Pricing of the cloud
	- Compute - pay for compute time
	- Storage - pay for data stored in the cloud
	- Data transfer OUT of the cloud - Data transfter IN is free

AWS Regions - A region is a cluster of data centers. Most AWS services are region-scoped
AWS Availability Zones - one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. They’re separate from each other, so that 
they’re isolated from disasters. They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations) - Content is delivered to end users with lower latency

** AWS service scoped
	- Global scoped - IAM, Route 53, CloudFront
	- Region-scoped - EC2, Elastic Breanstalk, Lambda, Rekognition

** Deployment models of the cloud
Private Cloud - Cloud service used by a single organization, not exposed to public 
Public Cloud - Cloud resources owned and operated by a 3rd party cloud service provider delivered over the internet [aws,azure,GCP]
Hybrid Cloud - Keep some servers on permises and extend some capabilities to the cloud

IAM (Identity and Access Management), Global Service. Groups only contains users not other groups. 
User don't have to belong to group but user can belong to multiple groups. Least privilege principle.

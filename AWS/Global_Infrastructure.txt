S3 Transfer Acceleration - Increase transfer speed by transferring file to an AWS edge location
which will forward the data to the S3 bucket in the target region

AWS Global Accelerator 
- Improve global application availability and performance using the AWS global network
- Leverage the AWS internal network to optimize the route to your application

CloudFront – Content Delivery Network
- Improves performance for your cacheable content (such as images and videos)
- Content is served at the edge

Global Accelerator
- No caching, proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
- Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
- Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
- Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

AWS Outposts 
- Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on-premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
- AWS will setup and manage Outposts Racks within your on-premises infrastructure and you 
	can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
	
AWS WaveLength 
- WaveLength Zones are infrastructure deployments embedded within the telecommunications
 providers datacenters at the edge of the 5G networks
- Use cases: Smart Cities, ML-assisted diagnostics, Connected Vehicles, Interactive Live Video Streams, AR/VR,
 Real-time Gaming
 
AWS Local Zones - Places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selected AWS services closer
to end users to run latency-sensitive applications

Global DNS: Route 53

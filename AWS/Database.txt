AWS Database

Benifits 
- Quick Provisioning, High Availability, Vertical and Horizontal Scaling, 
- Automated Backup & Restore, Operations, Upgrades 
- Operating System Patching is handled by AWS
- Monitoring, alerting

AWS RDS(Relational Database Service)

Advantage over using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2
Automated provisioning, OS patching
- Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
- Monitoring dashboards
- Read replicas for improved read performance
- Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
- Maintenance windows for upgrades
- Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
- Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)

Amazon Aurora - Costs more than RDS but is more efficient. Support both PostgreSQL and MySQL

Read Replicas - Scale the read workload of your DB. Data is only written to the main DB
Multi-AZ - Failover in case of AZ outage (high availability). Data is only read/written to the main database
	Replicate across AZ. Can only have 1 other AZ as failover. If AZ down connect to failover DB
Multi-Region - Disaster recovery in case of region issue

ElastiCache(Redis or Memcached) - Caches are in-memory databases with high performance, low latency
	- reduce load off databases for read intensive workloads

EMR - creating Hadoop clusters (Big Data) to analyze and process vast amount of data
	- clusters can be made of hundreds of EC2 instances
	- supports Apache Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink
	- data processing, machine learning, web indexing, big data
	
Athena - Serverless query service to analyze data stored in Amazon S3
		- Uses standard SQL language to query the files

QuickSight - Serverless machine learning-powered business intelligence service to create interactive dashboards
		- Integrated with RDS, Aurora, Athena, Redshift, S3

DocumentDB - AWS-implementation  for MongoDB(NoSQL database)

Neptune - Graph database. Ex social network

QLDB(Quantum Ledger Database) - recording financial transactions

Managed Blockchain - Blockchain makes it possible to build applications where multiple parties
can execute transactions without the need for a trusted, central authority

AWS Glue - Managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service

DMS – Database Migration Service - migrate databases
	- Homogeneous migrations: ex Oracle to Oracle
	- Heterogeneous migrations: ex Microsoft SQL Server to Aurora

VPC - Virtual Private Cloud - private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)

Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)

Public subnet - subnet that is accessible from the internet

Private subnet - subnet that is not accessible from the internet

Route Tables - define access to the internet and between subnets

Internet Gateways - VPC instances connect with the internet

NAT Gateways (AWS-managed)

NAT Instances (self-managed) -allow your instances in your 
	Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

NACL (Network ACL) - A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet
- Can have ALLOW and DENY rules
- Are attached at the Subnet level
- Rules only include IP addresses
- Stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules

Security Groups
- A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance
- Can have only ALLOW rules
- Rules include IP addresses and other security groups
- Stateful: Return traffic is allowed, regardless of the rules

VPC Flow Logs - IP traffic going into your interfaces VPC Flow Logs, Subnet Flow Logs, Elastic Network Interface Flow Logs
- helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues. Example: Subnets to internet, Subnets to subnets, Internet to subnets
- Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too: Elastic Load Balancers, ElastiCache, RDS, Aurora

VPC Peering - Connect two VPC, privately using AWS network

VPC Endpoints - allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network

AWS PrivateLink (VPC Endpoint Services) - Most secure & scalable way to expose a service to 1000s of VPCs

Site to Site VPN - Connect an on-premises VPN to AWS. Customer Gateway and Virtual Private Gateway needed

Direct Connect (DX) - Establish a physical connection between on-premises and AWS
 
AWS Client VPN - Connect from your computer using OpenVPN to your private network in AWS and on-premises
 
Transit Gateway -transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection

VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
- Subnets:Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
- Internet Gateway: at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
- NAT Gateway / Instances: give internet access to private subnets
- NACL: Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
- Security Groups: Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
- VPC Peering: Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, nontransitive
- VPC Endpoints: Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
- PrivateLink: Privately connect to a service in a 3rd party VPC
- VPC Flow Logs: network traffic logs
- Site to Site VPN: VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS
- Client VPN: OpenVPN connection from your computer into your VPC
- Direct Connect: direct private connection to AWS
- Transit Gateway: Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together
